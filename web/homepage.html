<p class="text" >Hello, my name is Michael Campbell and I'm a senior studying Software Engineering and I'm currently living Houston, Texas. As an aspsiring Software Engineer I have a love of computers and electronics. 
The qoute above is one of my favorites. It's became a motto of mine, to help lift me up when I'm feeling down. As likely apparent, I'm not to skilled at the artistic side of web design, but I hope that this class will help me improve.</p>
